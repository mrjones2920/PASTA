# PASTA 
 <h2>Activity Overview</h2>

 In this activity, you will practice using the Process of Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis (PASTA) threat model framework. You will determine whether a new shopping app is safe to launch.

Threat modeling is an important part of secure software development. Security teams typically perform threat models to identify vulnerabilities before malicious actors do. PASTA is a commonly used framework for assessing the risk profile of new applications.

<h2>Scenario</h2>

Youâ€™re part of the growing security team at a company for sneaker enthusiasts and collectors. The business is preparing to launch a mobile app that makes it easy for their customers to buy and sell shoes. 

You are performing a threat model of the application using the PASTA framework. You will go through each of the seven stages of the framework to identify security requirements for the new sneaker company app.
